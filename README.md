# Music Artist Partnership Website

This is a website designed to showcase and support young and upcoming music artists who may not yet be widely known. The website is still a work in progress, but the home page is complete.

# Features

- The Hero Section randomly displays different artists each time the page is refreshed.
- The page uses several animations, including a cool animation when clicking on the "Our roster is dedicated to growth" tab.
- All hovers use fade-in and fade-out effects, making the user experience more engaging.
- The "This is Collectible Partnership" section uses a grid layout that is both responsive and visually appealing.
- The "Reports on your partnership" section includes clickable tabs/cards that provide more information.
- The "Empowering Independence" section uses an array that includes classes with different sizes..

# Inspiration

This project was inspired by a design found on Dribble. The goal was to make the design a reality and make some tweaks and changes to it to create a unique website for supporting and showcasing emerging music artists.
